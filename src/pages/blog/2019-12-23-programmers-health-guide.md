## SITTING

> Sitting is the new smoking - Anonymous ​

### Sitting for long period

​ With short deadlines, bugs and client calls, we often forget to move away from our desk.
​
Sitting for long period with no activity can cause many health related issues to our body. Prolonged period of inactivity can lead to Diabetes, Cardiovascular Risk, Back issues, etc. This is a ticking health bomb waiting to explode.

According to recent <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/24-04-2019-to-grow-up-healthy-children-need-to-sit-less-and-play-more" target="_blank">WHO report</a>, over 23% of adults are not sufficiently physically active.

**What can we do:**

* Take a short walk, disturb your fellow co-worker, get some fresh air, play some games atleast once every hour.

### Bad Posture

​ When talking about sitting for long perion, it is easy to forget about Postures. Most of the people I know have bad postures including me. Poor postures can put pressure on your spine. With continued stress, it can lead to back pain, neck pain and sometimes even nerve related issues.

Lack of sleep can lead to Obesity, Heart disease, High blood pressure, etc. It even affects your way of thinking. As a developer you don't want this to happen.

**What can we do:** ​

* Try to have atleast 7 hours of sleep daily.
* Also make sure you go to bed around same time regularly.
* Stop using phones atleast 2 hours before going to bed.
* You can also use fitness trackers to track your sleep cycles.

## WATER

​ We drink water only when we get thirsty. But with our busy workflow and the work environment being Air conditioned we most often don't get thirsty and we often forget to drink water.
​
Water is one of the most required component for healthy functioning of our body. Our body is constantly losing water in the form of Sweat and Urine. Health authorities recommend a minimum of 2 litres of water intake every day.

**What can we do:** ​

* Try to drink water at regular interval even if you don't feel thirsty.
* You can find water reminder apps that gives you alert to drink water regularly

## STRESS

​ In the field of programming, stress is our best friend. You may say you love programming, you don't get stressed. But that's not true. Every programmer faces burn out, every programmer gets stressed.
​
Stress can often lead to Sleep problems, Headache, Digestion issues, etc.

**What can we do:** ​

* Take a break. Have a chat with your friends. A small session with friend can relieve most of your stress \[I assume you have friends :p]
* Take a day out.
* Follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank">Pomodoro Method</a>: Take a 5 minute break after every 25 minutes of work
